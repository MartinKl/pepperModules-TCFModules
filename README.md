pepperModules-TCFModules
==================
### General information
TCFModules is part of the [SaltNPepper](https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/p/projects/saltnpepper/) project. This Pepper module allows the conversion of data provided in the [TCF format](http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/weblichtwiki/index.php/The_TCF_Format) to Salt, a graph-based data model. TCF is a common XML data exchange format which has been developed within the [WebLicht](http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/weblichtwiki/) architecture.
This module has been developed in cooperation of the [Clarin-D](http://de.clarin.eu/) center Universit채t Stuttgart and the Humboldt-Universit채t zu Berlin.

Requirements
-------
Since the here provided module is a plugin for Pepper, you need an instance of the Pepper framework. If you do not already have a running Pepper instance, click on the link below and download the latest stable version (not a SNAPSHOT):
[SaltNPepper](http://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper/repository/saltNpepper_full/)

Install TCFModules
-------
If this Pepper module is not yet contained in your Pepper distribution, you can easily install it. Just open a command line and start pepper.

**Windows**
```
pepperStart.bat 
```

**Linux/Unix**
```
bash pepperStart.sh 
```

Pepper will start in command line mode (the command line starts with `pepper>`). To install this module, type:
```
update pepperModules-TCFModules
``` 
If your Pepper instance is configured for TCFModules, the update process will start. If not, you will read something like this:
```
pepperModules-TCFModules is not a known module.
``` 
To use pepperModules-TCFModules nevertheless, you can start the installation by adding an entry to Pepper's update list with the following command:
```
update de.hu_berlin.german.korpling.saltnpepper::pepperModules-TCFModules::https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/maven2 
``` 
Note, that the update is performed directly after typing that. From then on you will be able to start updates of pepperModules-TCFModules with `update pepperModules-TCFModules`.

## Usage
To use this module in your Pepper workflow, put the following lines into the workflow description file. Note the fixed order of xml elements in the workflow description file: &lt;importer/&gt, &lt;manipulator/&gt, &lt;exporter/&gt.
A detailed description of the Pepper workflow can be found on the [Pepper project site](https://github.com/korpling/pepper). 

### a) Identify the module by name

```xml
<importer name="TCFImporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
``` 
or
```xml
<exporter name="TCFExporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
``` 

### c) Use properties
```xml
<importer name="TCFImporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS">
  <customization>
    <property key="PROPERTY-1_NAME">PROPERTY-1_VALUE</key>
    <property key="PROPERTY-2_NAME">PROPERTY-2_VALUE</key>
    ...
  </customization>
</importer>
```

# TCFImporter

## Mapping to Salt

The importer maps each TCF layer to an SLayer object in Salt. Attributes refering to the
TCF layer are stored as meta annotations on the SLayer itself without using a
namespace. All annotations contained in the TCF layer are imported as annotations on
SToken and/or SSpan objects where the annotation's namespace is (in most cases, cf.
table below) the SLayer's name and the annotation's name is the tag's name without
the xml namespace or the attributes name. E.g.:
```xml
&lt;constituent cat="VVFIN" ID="c_1" tokenIDs="t_1"/>
``` 
In this case the token is annotated with syntax::cat="VVFIN" in the salt model. An overview of all TCF-Layers and according SLayers can be found in the following table:
|TCF layer|namespace of annotation|node annotation names|edge annotation names|meta annotations on SLayer|
