This [Pepper module](https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/p/projects/saltnpepper/wiki/#Overview) allows the conversion of data provided in the XML based Clarin pipeline format [TCF](weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/weblichtwiki/index.php/The_TCF_Format) to Salt. The conversion from Salt to TCF will be implemented soon.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\nAfter converting your TCF data to Salt it can be converted to a whole list of other linguistic data formats, e.g. the RelANNIS format used to visualize linguistic data in the linguistic tool [ANNIS](http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/annis). A complete list of data formats Salt can be mapped on can be found [here](https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/p/projects/saltnpepper/wiki/#Official-Pepper-modules).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Brief documentation\r\nThe TCF format provides several layers of linguistic annotations. Each TCF layer is mapped on its own layer in Salt, a graph based data format. These layers contain either nodes (e.g. POS annotation), edges (e.g. dependency annotation) or both (e.g. coreference annotation) together with their annotations. The layer's name is the annotation's namespace at the same time. General layer information contained in TCF attributes is stored as meta annotation on the layer itself.\r\nA full documentation can be found here soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Flags\r\nThe converter can be used with a flag SHRINK_TOKEN_ANNOTATIONS. If this flag is true (default), annotations of single tokens are bound directly to the token node in the Salt graph; spans are only used if two are more tokens are meant to be annotated with a single value. If SHRINK_TOKEN_ANNOTATIONS is false, a span is also build over single tokens. In this case all annotations are bound to spans and the annotation layers only contain span elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact, questions, bug reports, etc.\r\nYou can contact us for all issues here: saltnpepper@lists.hu-berlin.de","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
